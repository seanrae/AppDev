Thief No More: An Arduino-Based Smart Security System
======================================================

Introduction

Thief No More is a smart anti-theft security system designed using the Arduino Uno microcontroller. It combines motion detection, 
biometric verification, and real-time alerts to enhance the safety of homes or small businesses. This system is a cost-effective 
solution for improving security by immediately detecting unauthorized access and notifying the user.

How It Works
The PIR motion sensor detects movement near the entrance.
The system sounds a buzzer alarm and prompts the individual to verify their identity using a fingerprint sensor.
If a valid fingerprint is scanned, the alarm stops.
If authentication fails or is skipped the buzzer continues to sound.
A GSM module sends an SMS alert to the owner's phone.
