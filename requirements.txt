## Arduino Library Requirements

Before uploading the code, ensure the following libraries are installed in the **Arduino IDE**:

1. **Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor Library**
   - Go to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...**
   - Search for **Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor Library** and install it.

2. **SoftwareSerial Library** (usually pre-installed with Arduino IDE)

## Fingerprint Enrollment Guide

To register fingerprints into the sensor:

1. Open the **Arduino IDE** and upload the **enroll** example sketch found in:
   - `File > Examples > Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor Library > enroll`

2. Open the **Serial Monitor**, set the baud rate to **9600**, and follow the prompts:
   - Enter a unique ID for each fingerprint.
   - Place and remove your finger as instructed.
   - Once enrolled, these fingerprints can be recognized in the main program.
